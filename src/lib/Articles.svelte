  <div class="Article-body">
    <p>
      Just a few lines of Toit code are needed to reap the full benefits of the Toit ecosystem —
      without having to rely on firmware developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choosing Toit for your IoT project means that your ESP32-based devices become as easy to
      program as smartphones: develop your app, deploy it to the devices of your choice, and then
      update and reinstall as often as needed, even on a shaky connection — all that while the other
      apps on the device keep running. Welcome to the 21st century, IoT!
